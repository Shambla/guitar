				<p>Mr. Streckfus has been studying music in college level institutions for eight years and holds an Associate of Arts of Music from
				Harford Community College and a Bachelors in Classical Guitar Performance from Peabody Conservatory of the Johns Hopkins University.
				His former teachers include Ray Chester, a former student of Aaron Shearer, head chairman of guitar at Peabody Conservatory
				and one of the world's leading guitar pedagogues. Brian has also received music instruction from other well trained guitarists in the
				Maryland region such as Peabody Alumni, James Hontz, Ph D. and jazz guitarists Brian Kooken and Vincent Corson.</p>
				<p>Brian has performed jazz, popular, and classical genres at Maryland music venues such as Baltimore's Lyric Opera House, Miriam A.
				Friedberg Concert Hall, The Recher Theatre, Fret Fest at Goodwin Hall, Cohen-Davison Family Theatre, Fallston Hall, and Fletcher's.</p>
				<p>Brian also has a home recording studio and has produced over seventy music related videos that are viewed worldwide. The purposes

				modern approach, diverse repertoire and music technology skills make him an excellent music instructor.</p>
